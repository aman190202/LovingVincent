## Inspiration

**Loving Vincent** is a 2017 experimental animated biographical drama film about the life of the painter Vincent van Gogh. It is the first fully painted animated feature film. The film, written and directed by Dorota Kobielaand Hugh Welchman, is a Polish-UK co-production, funded by the Polish Film Institute, and partially through a Kickstarter campaign.

Each of the film's 65,000 frames is an oil painting on canvas, created using the same techniques as Van Gogh by a team of 125 artists drawn from around the globe. It won Best Animated Feature Film Award at the 30th European Film Awards in Berlin and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 90th Academy Awards.

A movie production of this kind demands a huge capital and a huge time frame. For an arts student trying to re-create this movie under a student budget, the entire process is an impossible task.

From a financial perspective: 
• Hiring a team of 2000 painters over a 6-year course period accounts to a production cost in millions. 
• A selection round of 5000 painters is again a hefty task
